# Monte Carlo Simulations

Conducted over 10,000,000 simulations, where we visualized the outcomes and examined the precision and effectiveness of different Monte Carlo techniques in estimating Euler's number. Done as part of an explorative research paper for International Baccalaureate.

Dependencies:
- matplotlib==3.5.3
